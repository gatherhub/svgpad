# SvgPad
SvgPad is a library for peer-to-peer white-board application implemented in HTML5 SVG and WebSocket. It is a partial work of Gatherhub. Check out the demo here, http://gatherhub.com/ (The website is under reconstruction to adapt new [PeerCom] (https://github.com/gatherhub/peercom) and [MSR] (https://github.com/gatherhub/msgsrouter) modules. The peer-to-peer white-board and messaging will not be working until the reconstrution finished.)
